This script lets you block/ignore requesters from your search results. It will place a little 'x' beside each requester's name. To block, just click the 'x'. This helps clean up your search results, and saves you time when you block scammers/requesters with poor ratings.  Props to  xxdohxx  for reviving this script and fixing it so it works in Chrome!
